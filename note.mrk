You always take benefits if you have the receipture or the source code in your hands. Better if you made it, then you can exponentially increase your speed of realisations. Building becomes easy and efficient. This may eventually be according to some development ideas i.e. 2 bits or 3 bits of dev:
Prio 1: Shall be always: most adapted tool for each given specific purpose.
Prio 2: Freedom has no price. Thus, source code and chop all libraries or dependencies. (reliable, always there, compilable, forever with you without endless re-make and re-coding. Anywhere. Anytime. Simply compile and run!).
Prio 3: Several smaller clients (e.g. prg, applications) are better than a single large one. (Always focus on lower footprint, Smaller CPU and Ram usage. Rewrite and chop the code regularly, check compilation for simplest way and fairly bug/warning free. Create a new filename (or version) for a most advanced/improved version of software. Keep minimum first basic, original, small + working source code of your programme.)
Just 3 points of importance to be the pillars of development realisations.
